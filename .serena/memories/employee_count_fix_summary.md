# Employee Count Fix Summary

## Issue
The payroll module was showing only 8 employees while the HR module correctly showed 9 employees.

## Root Cause
Inconsistent database queries between HR and Payroll modules:
- HR used: `{ isArchived: { $ne: true } }` (excludes only explicitly archived)
- Payroll was using: `{ isArchived: false }` (requires explicit false value)

## Solution Applied
Updated all payroll employee queries to match HR logic:

### Files Modified:
1. **services/payroll/payrollEmployeeService.ts**
   - `getAllEmployees()`: Changed to `{ isArchived: { $ne: true } }`
   - Line 160: Matches HR API logic

2. **models/PayrollEmployee.ts**
   - `searchByName()`: Updated to exclude only explicitly archived
   - Line 290: Added `{ isArchived: { $ne: true } }` to search criteria

## Query Pattern Explanation
- `{ isArchived: { $ne: true } }` includes:
  - Documents where isArchived is false
  - Documents where isArchived is null
  - Documents where isArchived is undefined
- This matches the HR module's behavior and ensures all non-archived employees appear

## Verification
Both HR and Payroll modules now use identical query logic, ensuring all 9 employees appear consistently across the application.
